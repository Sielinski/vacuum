Description: Vacuum is an implementation of three procedures developed by 
    John Tukey: FUNOP, FUNOR-FUNOM, and vacuum cleaner. Combined, they 
    provide a way to identify, treat, and analyze outliers in two-way 
    (i.e., contingency) tables, as described in Tukey's original paper 
    "The Future of Data Analytics".
