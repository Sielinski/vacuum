Description: An implementation of three procedures developed by 
    John Tukey: FUNOP (FUll NOrmal Plot), FUNOR-FUNOM 
    (FUll NOrmal Rejection-FUll NOrmal Modification), and vacuum cleaner. 
    Combined, they provide a way to identify, treat, and analyze outliers 
    in two-way (i.e., contingency) tables, as described in his 
    landmark paper "The Future of Data Analysis", Tukey, John W. (1962) 
    <doi:10.1214/aoms/1177704711>.
